      <p>The mission of eLearning project was to create a quality website for General Practitioners on "suicide prevention training". The training program is divided into three topics which contain video and audio presentations, case study assessments, interactive learning activities, and a host of other useful resources.</p>
      <p>This was a collaboration project with Phuong Huynh and my primary role is as a User Experience Designer and Front-End Developer.</p>
      <p>We worked directly with Associate Professor Owen Carter from Edith Cowan University to design a web app to meet this goal.</p>
      <p>In the planning phase, I created a site flow that shows a high level view of the site size and complexity. It also showed how the pages should link to each other.</p>

      <p>The design process starts with creating an interactive low-fidelity wireframe by using InVision to establish site structure, reflow and functionality. I used it as part of the Usability Phase to determine best arrangement of elements and their functionality.</p>

      <p>With high-fidelity wireframes, it showed the client that how the layout, navigation, buttons and form elements are coming together and is a nice way to see how the interaction works.</p>
