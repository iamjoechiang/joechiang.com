            <p>Hi, I am Joe. I live in Perth and work in Web Design and Development at Curtin University, Western Australia</p>

            <p>This is my portfolio of work and my <a href="/journal/">Journal</a> on travel and technology.</p>
            <p>I enjoy working with people to create websites that are easy and intuitive to use. <strong>Simplicity</strong> and <strong>Clarity</strong> are my two main goals when designing websites and user interfaces. I am more interested in giving you a solution to having an online presence that works for you and your customers and clients than the option that would make me the most money.</p>
            <p>So if you have a project in mind - I would love to help you out. Please email me at <a href="mailto:&#104;&#101;&#108;&#108;&#111;&#064;&#106;&#111;&#101;&#099;&#104;&#105;&#097;&#110;&#103;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;&#046;&#097;&#117;" title="Send me an email">&#104;&#101;&#108;&#108;&#111;&#064;&#106;&#111;&#101;&#099;&#104;&#105;&#097;&#110;&#103;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;&#046;&#097;&#117;</a>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I was born in Taiwan and moved to Japan when I was nine. After university, I worked as a Software Engineer for two years before migrating to Australia.</p>
            <p>I am not always in front of a computer &ndash; I also enjoy playing beach volleyball and will hopefully learn surfing this summer.</p>
